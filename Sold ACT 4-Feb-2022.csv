It can determine your lifestyle, your interests, and it can even influence the food you eat. Canberra locals know that living centrally is priceless, and there are very few locations that offer the best of city living, while keeping the vibe effortlessly cool.<br/> <br/>Being close to the action, yet grounded within a local community is a balance not often achieved, but 7/43 Ipima Street certainly ticks both boxes.<br/> <br/>On a quiet, leafy street and inside a boutique apartment block (there are only 19 apartments in the complex), you'll find this lovely light filled, one bedroom apartment. Making an efficient use of space, this north facing unit is unlike many of the high-rise apartments in the area. This property feels less like a hotel, and more like a home.<br/> <br/>This gorgeous, light and airy modern apartment is less than a 5 minute drive to the award-winning Ainslie IGA (who proudly boasts the largest cheese selection in the ACT). And a short walk will take you to the centre of Braddon-the hippest suburb of Canberra, where you'll find the best bars, coffee shops and retail stores. <br/> <br/>Nearby Haig Park has been revitalised and is now the perfect place to unpack a picnic and attend one of the many community events throughout the year, including the popular, Haig Park Village Farmer's Markets every Sunday.<br/> <br/>Its proximity to Canberra City and Northbourne Avenue makes for easy access to other suburbs and central shopping hubs. Plus, it will take you less than 10 minutes to ride your scooter to the ANU.<br/> <br/>If getting amongst nature (before an awesome Braddon breakfast) is your thing, the famous Mt Ainslie ascent is easily accessible.<br/> <br/>Don't miss this great opportunity to purchase an excellent property without the hassle of finding a tenant.

The sunny north easterly aspect of this home, and the uninterrupted views of Mt Ainslie give you a sense of light and space, but the real showstopper is the oversized 38 square metre outdoor living area that feels more like a courtyard than a balcony.  <br/><br/>There is so much to love about this apartment, which is styled with a modern industrial chic, with a polished concrete ceiling in the living room, and a stylish floating industrial metal sheet combined with soft halogen lighting. Window furnishings of floor-to-ceiling curtains and soft carpet underfoot bring balance to the internal décor, while freshly painted walls give you a neutral backdrop to style your home and make it your own. <br/><br/>Your main bedroom looks out onto an expansive view of Mount Ainslie, perfect for breakfast in bed or sipping a cup of coffee on a Saturday morning. Your second bedroom has a built-in study nook and is spacious enough for a double bed positioned in the middle of the room and bed side tables. If you don't need a second bedroom, this can be used as a home office, a home gym, or an amazing walk-in robe with a dressing area and makeup table. <br/><br/>Your kitchen, dining and living room are open plan, and combined with your over-sized balcony, provide plenty of living space. The balcony is covered in wooden parquetry tiles that feel good under foot, and the right-angled design allows you room for a large dining table, and a large furniture setting and potted plants.  <br/><br/>The balcony runs the full width of the apartment, and is accessed from both the living area and the main bedroom through double glazed floor to ceiling sliding glass doors, bringing the outside in, and joining the two separate spaces into one indoor/outdoor lifestyle space measuring 108 square metres.  <br/><br/>Imagine starting your weekend with Friday drinks on your balcony with friends, with chilled wine from your built-in wine fridge, taking in the views of Mt Ainslie. Within a short walk you can continue with a great dinner at one of the many venues on Lonsdale Street, or cook at home with your well-equipped kitchen with Smeg appliances, and stone benchtops. <br/><br/>Follow your meal with some dancing at any of the popular venues along your street or have a quiet coffee after dinner at your favourite coffee shop. Wake up on Saturday and head to the gym, grab your favourite juice, and have breakfast on your balcony by nine, and spend your afternoon window shopping or spending time with friends either at home or at one of Lonsdale Street's many venues, and return for the spectacular sunset on your balcony. <br/><br/>This home offers not just a sanctuary with amazing views, but a lifestyle available nowhere else in Canberra, in the heart of the city.

His distinctive style influenced the inner suburbs of Canberra as our first private architect. Homes that are beautifully detailed, crafted and soundly constructed have stood the test of time for nearly 100 years. <br/><br/>Many of these homes can be found scattered around Canberra, many have been renovated, but only a few are presented with the same grace and refined luxury as 15 Farrer Street Braddon.<br/><br/>A home created with a strong sense of nostalgia, the award winning renovation demonstrates the beauty of updating older homes. 15 Farrer Street is a home interwoven with heritage and modern functionality, where the finest of details have been considered and cared for during the meticulous renovations designed by Gina Carmody. <br/><br/>Signature Oliphant elements are found in the fireplaces, timber detailing and integrated joinery, ornate ceilings and cornices. The retained heritage integrated with modern amenity inspires new futures while keeping a history alive.<br/><br/>In the early 1930s when this home was built many of the handmade bricks and roof tiles were brought by horse and cart from Sydney.  Rumours have it that when the Queen first came to Canberra in the 1950s she drove down Farrer Street.  All of this said while the house has many heritage features and detailing the property is not heritage listed.<br/><br/>The luxury of time is an unexpected delight of the Oliphant.home. Years of love and passion are found in the exquisite gardens, established trees and flowering plants; a very special gift that enhances the experience of the home. Integration of home and garden is enhanced by access to the front garden from the main bedroom, with a covered outdoor entertaining area at the rear. A large bay window in the lounge frames the view to the garden and beyond to the established plane trees enveloping the street.<br/><br/>Time can be reclaimed. Life is easy living local, the highly enviable position on Farrer Street is remarkably close to Braddon and the city. It's hard to believe such a serene quiet setting is within a short stroll to the vibrant Lonsdale Street and the City Centre. Local tennis courts, Ainslie School and cultural institutions are all on your doorstep.<br/><br/>Braddon becomes your second home, a vibrant shopping and foodie precinct where you'll find a mingled assortment of boutiques, cafes, bakeries, restaurants and bars. As Braddon and the city continues its exciting renewal and growth, this residential street's beauty and enduring character are assured by its unique position and premium location; a quiet street tucked within the City edge.<br/><br/>15 Farrer Street is a home that you will love, in the location you desire, with the lifestyle you covet.<br/><br/>features<br/>.designed by Kenneth Oliphant in1933, extensively modernised in 2002 design by Gina Carmody<br/>.MBA National Award winner for best renovation/extension<br/>.renewed strapped ceiling detail, renovated fireplaces, solid oak windows and picture rails preserved.

On a sunny day people are relaxing on the lawns with their pets; something I don't see in other developments. The apartments are bright and light. Plants are being placed along the walkways and the character of Lowanna is continually developing.  People particularly note the care that has been placed on detailing the project.
