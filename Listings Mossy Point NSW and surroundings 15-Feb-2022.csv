Most new doors and windows are in and the wiring has almost been completed with new downlights and switches. My vendors are also leaving a list of materials they had already purchased to finish the project - making it even easier for the lucky buyer.<br/><br/>This property is set on a great block with a 25m frontage that faces directly north. It enjoys some beautiful established trees that create a feeling of privacy from the neighbors and street. <br/><br/>This property enjoys two gates for access to a single garage attached to the home with a work shop space and a separate double garage. The renovations taking place have all occurred within the existing building so there is no need for tricky council approvals. There is also scope to further extend the home north if the need arises in the future.<br/><br/>The position and aspect of this home as well as the ability to use it straight away makes this a great opportunity for those who are handy on the tools and want to add value to their investment.<br/><br/>Selling by online auction, this opportunity is not one to be missed!
