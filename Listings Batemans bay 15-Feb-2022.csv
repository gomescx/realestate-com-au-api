From a developers point there is agreement in principal that the properties on either side with the same zoning and size ( see plan ) could be negotiated as well in the future, so with over 3,000sqm of potential prime development land available in the heart of Batemans Bay, it's an opportunity not to be missed. <br/><br/>The zoning allows up to a 12 metre height limit as it fronts the golf course, so its possible to realise 4 levels on the site (STCA). The owners have commissioned an architect to design a basic concept of what may work on the site, so it is up to the canny developer to decide what will work best for their needs - but you have a concept to start with. Or it may just be possible that someone will work on bringing the grand old home built in 1955 back to its former glory, just to enjoy the magnificent views over the Catalina championship golf course and out to the Tollgates, over to Long Beach and beyond.<br/><br/>The property is located close to the CBD, Soldiers Club and you can putt a ball straight onto the golf course! The Marina is handy as well, so the location is perfect. Batemans Bay is in the middle of a growth spurt so a well designed development with a never to be lost vista would surely be of interest to the market. There just isn't many spots available like this. Batemans Bay is around 4 hours from Southern Sydney and around a 2 hour drive from the nations capital so its an area that is sure to attract more interest in the lifestyle it offers to the people escaping the major cities. <br/><br/>There is a tenant who would love to stay on while you consider your options!<br/><br/>Call today to secure your piece of the South Coast.","[Lister(id='1414970', name='Rob Routledge', agent_id=None, job_title='Licensed Real Estate Agent', url='https://www.realestate.com.au/agent/rob-routledge-1414970?cid={cid}', phone=None, email=None)]"
